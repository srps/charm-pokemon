- **Multilingual**: Comprehensive data in both Portuguese (PT-BR) and English.
- **Live Search**: Find Pokemon instantly by name or ID.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher

### Installation & Build

For the best experience, build the optimized version which embeds all Pokemon data and ASCII art:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/charm-pokemon.git
cd charm-pokemon

# Build the optimized executable
go build -tags realdata -ldflags="-s -w" -o pokemon.exe .

# Run it!
./pokemon.exe
```

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/↓` or `j/k` | Navigate menus and lists |
| `←/→` or `h/l` | Browse Pokemon in Pokedex |
| `Enter` | Select / View details |
| `1` | Open Search |
| `2` | Browse by Type |

| `q` / `Esc` | Back / Exit |

## 🛠️ Data & Optimization

The project uses a sophisticated data pipeline to minimize binary size while maintaining high quality:

1. **Downloader**: Fetches latest data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
2. **Sprite Converter**: Generates high-fidelity ASCII and Sixel art.
3. **Data Minifier**: Strips unused API fields (movesets, URLs) to reduce JSON size by ~80%.
4. **Build Tags**: Uses `-tags realdata` to switch between sample development data and the full embedded dataset.

To rebuild the data from scratch:
```bash
go run tools/download_data/main.go
go run tools/convert_sprites/main.go
go run tools/minify_data/main.go
```
